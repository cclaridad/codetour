## What we did

We evaluated the accessibility of the Visual Studio Code CodeTour extension for blind and low-vision users. Based on our findings, we made prototype-quality changes to CodeTour to improve accessibility. Finally, we identified future work items that could make CodeTour and Visual Studio Code itself more accessible.

## Disability justice

Throughout the project, we worked with Venkatesh Potluri who is a blind programmer. Venkatesh gave us a first-person disability perspective and informed much of our work. We specifically focused on the following disability justice principles.

### Leadership of most impacted

We directly engaged with Venkatesh to gather feedback on the CodeTour experience for blind users. Based on his usability and accessibility feedback, we made changes and further improvements to our prototype. We are grateful for his valuable time and advice.

### Recognizing wholeness

We recognize that blind people are also programmers. We must ensure CodeTour functionality is made accessible to these programmers, whether they use a mouse, keyboard, monitor, or screen reader.

### Interdependence

CodeTour is an open source project on GitHub. Open source allows groups like ours to collaborate directly in the developer community, without corporate sponsors. We can make improvements to meet our needs and the needs of community members with disabilities.
